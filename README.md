# roulette
horrendous vibe coded bullshit for a school project

many thanks to trondkla for their [roulette wheel](https://github.com/trondkla/roulette-wheel) code

## features, i think
- bet on color only
- clear bet
- bet on number
- bias slider for dealer (the house always wins)
- open/close bets buttons for dealer
- diff colored badges for win by number/color/color but wrong number
